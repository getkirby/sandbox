title: Builder

fields:
  builder:
    label: Page Builder
    type: builder
    columns: 1 # Optional. If set to 2 or more, the builder blocks will be placed in a grid.
    max: 10 # Optional. Limits the number of builder blocks that can be added.
    fieldsets:
      quote: # This is a field set. It contains a group of kirby fields. The user can select from these sets to build the content.
        name: Quote # The name option is used as a label for the buttons to add new fieldsets. It is also used as a label in the header of the fieldset, if the label option is not set explicitly (see next line).
        label: Quote by {{citation}} # Optional. The label option can be used to override the header text of the fieldset. The 'mustache' syntax can be used to include the value of any field of the fieldset.
        preview: # Optional. If defined, a preview of the fieldset can be rendered by the specified snippet from within the snippets folder.
          snippet: blocks/quote
          css: /assets/css/blocks/quote.css
        defaultView: preview # Optional. If the value "preview" is set, the block will show the preview when the page is loaded in the panel. If the value is a tab name, the respective tab is preselected when the page is loaded. Newly created blocks ignore this value and have the edit mode or the first tab preselected.

        name: Text
        tabs: # Optional. Tabs can be used to group the fields of a field set. In this example, we use one tab to contain the content related fields and one for styling settings. It makes no difference for the content handling in the template if there are tabs or not.
          content:
            label: Content
            icon: edit # Optional. This icon appears next to the tab. The icon name can be chosen from the Kirby's icon set getkirby.com/docs/reference/ui/icon
